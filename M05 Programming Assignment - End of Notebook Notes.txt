After running the tests in the notebook, I can see that the results confirm the functions work as expected. The first test, which uses pytest, checks if the sum function is correctly calculating the total of a list of numbers, and it passed without any errors. The second test using unittest also passed, showing that the sum function works in different testing structures. These results mean that the code is functioning as it should, and both testing methods verify the accuracy and reliability of the sum function.
